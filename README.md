#PML Assignment: Predict manner of exercise


##Introduction
It has been noted that commonly research in how much on does a particular activity is quantified, however it is less often that the manner in which the exercise was done is classified from worse to better.

In this research, we build a prediction model based on Human Activity Recognition data collected by 6 participants wearing accelerometers in 4 parts of the body during exercise namely, belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell. The prediction model will be used to classify the different manner in which the exercise was performed, A,B,C,D,E where A is the exercise being performed correctly and the alternative classes being common mistakes made during the exercise.
